    <h1>
      Hel spent over 35 years believing she was broken
    </h1>

    <br>
    <p>
  When she was diagnosed as autistic in 2019 (and then ADHD in 2022) she didn't think much would change. It just confirmed what she already knew.
  <br><br>

But over time she realised how her whole self-image was constructed around the idea of her being a broken neurotypical person - and not a perfectly normal neurodivergent person trying to cope in a disabling neurotypical world
<br><br>
Hel had unconsciously built a career trying to square this circle. She spent 15+ years as talent strategy specialist, working for the likes of Accenture and PA Consulting to build employee experiences that were inclusive of those who experienced the world differently.
<br><br>
After her diagnoses, Hel narrowed her focus to building neuroinclusive experiences, from leadership training to HR processes. She became a community lead, working directly with her fellow neurodivergents to build on their strengths and confidence, and enable them to flourish at work.
<br><br>
As an accredited ADHD Works coach, and trainer and content creator, Hel aims to celebrate, advocate and normalise the AuDHD work experience. Because when neurodivergent people have access to what they need to be successful at work, everybody wins.
